# Admin Dashboard

## An Admin Dashboard created from HTML/CSS

As a part of The Odin Project, I developed a dashboard as one of my projects. The goal was to sharpen my skills in utilizing the grid display. I utilized grids in every layout, including nested grids, and aimed to make the webpage as responsive as possible. Finding a suitable color scheme was a time-consuming process. Through this project, I strengthened my abilities in the following areas:

**CSS**

* Using the Grid layout
* Responsiveness using min-max
